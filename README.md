# Mig-gres

The goal of this project is to build a tiny drop-in Java service that will be able to update a Postgresql schema. 

## Development

The project uses maven to handle dependencies.

Create an environment variable called `MIG_GRES_PATH` that points to a directory for persistence.

Run `mvn clean install` and run against a Java web container.

There is an included Dockerfile which can be used to create images with Alpine Linux, Java 8 and Jetty 9.4.
